# TelegramGallery3
## An Android Online gallery app built with Jetpack Compose
### Discription
Everyone knows that an infinite number of files can be stored in favorites, so why not make a gallery out of it? the files will be stored remotely on telegram servers and will not take up space on the phone, in addition, a tag system is implemented that makes it easy to navigate through your files. Files are uploaded only via the [Python application](https://github.com/Rikki1004/GalleryDownloader)
### Opportunities
1) previews are automatically created for photos and videos
2) scans are automatically created for the video (for the preview window)
3) the video does not need to be downloaded completely to be viewed!, a 5mb piece is enough
4) tag system and search for them to quickly find what you need
5) all this is stored on telegram servers, and the source code of this application is open - no one will steal your data
