# TelegramGallery3
## An Android Online gallery app built with Jetpack Compose

Everyone knows that an infinite number of files can be stored in favorites, so why not make a gallery out of it? the files will be stored remotely on telegram servers and will not take up space on the phone, in addition, a tag system is implemented that makes it easy to navigate through your files. Files are uploaded via the [Python application](https://github.com/Rikki1004/GalleryDownloader)
